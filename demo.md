# WordPress demo

    This is a PILOT PROJECT used to determine if it is worth continuing.
    
    ~ 50 % of our new business comes from web leads!!
    
    Value:
    - Should be less expensive to own and provide a better user experience.  This has NOT been quoted yet.
    - Wordpress is a simple Industry Standard Platform for building websites including e-commerce web sites.
    - Tons of Themes and web pieces available without any coding... yet you can code specific functions if you need to.
    - Product categorizing, filtering, upsells, cross-sells, ratings...
    - Canned shopping cart and 
    
    - I want to show how much is available "out of the box".
    - We would need to hire professional web developer, and popssibly some coding talent.  But there might not be that much to do.

    Notes regarding this demo
    - Our current website is filled with great content.  It is so free-form that it is expensive to improve.   
    
    
    - It is a demonstration of Wordpress capabilities only.
    - It is not complete or even correct
    - It is certainly not ready to be released to the public.
    
    - The Theme and colors were seleted because then are "good enough" to demonstrate capabilities.
    - The colors were seleted because then are "good enough" to demonstrate capabilities.
    
    
    - Enough data was entered to give a flavor of how it can work. It is not complete or even all correct.
    - Most of the info and images were scraped off our current site. 
    - This entire demo is using free software except for the Products Filter. 
    - There are many upgrades you can pay for.
    - Zero code was written for this demo.  It is all point-and-click.
    
    - Product categories.  Similar to current web site.
    - Products, filters.  It only shows applicable filters.  Shows # products in the filter.  I would change to checkmark like REI.
    - Products.  
        - I bundled most of the choices into product Variations:  Color/size/style...  I broke Inkjet out to emphasize the color.
        - Unavailable choices are disabled.
        - Whole image gallary per product.
        - Product image can change for every variation
        - price can change for every variation
        
        - Upsells, Crosssells, Related Products.
        - Product compare
        - Quantity discounts
        
     -  
    

  Changes I would start with if continuing with this theme:
  -  Select Color scheme.
  -  Add graphic to Category text
  -  Scale all product images to be the same size
  -  Clean up "Add to card" 
  -  Show section of "sub-categories", then a seperate section on "products"
